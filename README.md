A landing page &amp; a blog that I made from scratch for a non-profit company located in Spain

I got the API that show players data from [tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/developers), Then I used Postman to test the API by createing HTTP/s requests and reading their responses.
Then I built the Fron-End from scratch using Vue.js with Vue-router

## Technologies
### Front-End:
* Vue.js with Vue-router

* Node.js/Express.js
