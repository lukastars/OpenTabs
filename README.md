A landing page &amp; a blog that I made for a non-profit organization located in Spain.

I built the landing page I made from scratch to show the company's missions such as (Saving Rainforests, Preventing Malaria, and Providing Microloans) and to show how to download our browser extension that is the main source of the company's donations. The website includes pages for (Landing page, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, FAQ, Financial Reports)

And I also made a blog for the company to share its latest updates and news with the world in a simple and elegant style.
